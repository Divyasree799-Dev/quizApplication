## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**  

2.Configure database
Update your application.properties (or application.yml) file with your database credentials.

3.Build and run the application   
4.Test API using Postman
Use Postman to send requests to your endpoints (default URL: (http://localhost:8082/user)).You can change server port

Example API Request (Using Postman)
Create User (POST)
URL: http://localhost:8082/question/add
